# Turkey



Turkey is a Java desktop application that is developed for a real customer and meets real requirements.
By this software the user can trace and keep a record of a season related to raising turkeys at industrial level.

I implemented this application as my thesis in university.

Please note that because this was a work for a Hungarian University, the comments in the code are in Hungarian. Variable names, however, are in English.

It runs on a MySQL database and I used NetBeans as the developer environment.

Used MySQL version: 5.5.24

Initial username: user

To create the database for the application please execute turkeybase.sql file.
Command in MySQL command line, depending on the file path:<br>
source c:\turkeybase.sql
